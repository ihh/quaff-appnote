                 routinely used to finish microbial genomes, but available
                 assembly methods have not scaled well to larger genomes. We

                 reference-grade de novo assemblies of Saccharomyces

                 a human hydatidiform mole cell line (CHM1) from SMRT

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Genome sequence alignments form the basis of much
                 research. Genome alignment depends on various mundane but
                 critical choices, such as how to mask repeats and which score
                 parameters to use. Surprisingly, there has been no large-scale
                 assessment of these choices using real genomic data. Moreover,
                 rigorous procedures to control the rate of spurious alignment
                 have not been employed. RESULTS: We have assessed 495
                 combinations of score parameters for alignment of animal,
                 plant, and fungal genomes. As our gold-standard of accuracy,
                 we used genome alignments implied by multiple alignments of
                 proteins and of structural RNAs. We found the HOXD scoring
                 schemes underlying alignments in the UCSC genome database to
                 be far from optimal, and suggest better parameters. Higher
                 values of the X-drop parameter are not always better. E-values
                 accurately indicate the rate of spurious alignment, but only
                 if tandem repeats are masked in a non-standard way. Finally,
                 we show that gamma-centroid (probabilistic) alignment can find
                 highly reliable subsets of aligned bases. CONCLUSIONS: These
                 results enable more accurate genome alignment, with
                 reliability measures for local alignments and for individual
                 aligned bases. This study was made possible by our new

                 accuracy values can be predicted for commonly used scoring
                 schemes and sequence divergences (the PAM and BLOSUM series).
                 Finally we describe how to calculate the expected accuracy of
                 a given alignment, and show how this can be used to construct
                 an optimal accuracy alignment algorithm which generates
                 significantly more accurate alignments than standard dynamic
                 programming methods in simulated experiments.",

  abstract    = "Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) overcomes limitations of
                 previously used RNA quantification methods and provides one
                 experimental framework for both high-throughput
                 characterization and quantification of transcripts at the
                 nucleotide level. The first step and a major challenge in the
                 analysis of such experiments is the mapping of sequencing
                 reads to a transcriptomic origin including the identification
                 of splicing events. In recent years, a large number of such
                 mapping algorithms have been developed, all of which have in
                 common that they require algorithms for aligning a vast number
                 of reads to genomic or transcriptomic sequences. Although the
                 FM-index based aligner Bowtie has become a de facto standard
                 within mapping pipelines, a much larger number of possible
                 alignment algorithms have been developed also including other
                 variants of FM-index based aligners. Accordingly, developers
                 and users of RNA-seq mapping pipelines have the choice among a
                 large number of available alignment algorithms. To provide
                 guidance in the choice of alignment algorithms for these
                 purposes, we evaluated the performance of 14 widely used
                 alignment programs from three different algorithmic classes:
                 algorithms using either hashing of the reference
                 transcriptome, hashing of reads, or a compressed FM-index
                 representation of the genome. Here, special emphasis was
                 placed on both precision and recall and the performance for
                 different read lengths and numbers of mismatches and indels in
                 a read. Our results clearly showed the significant reduction
                 in memory footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based
                 aligners at a precision and recall comparable to the best hash
                 table based aligners. Furthermore, the recently developed
                 Bowtie 2 alignment algorithm shows a remarkable tolerance to
                 both sequencing errors and indels, thus, essentially making
                 hash-based aligners obsolete.",
